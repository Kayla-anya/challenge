            <ArticleText>Based on a chart that shows Undergraduate Employment Rates by Race/Ethnicity by BWDC
                <strong>Asian American</strong> students have the highest rate of employment
                at 6.9 %.</ArticleText>
            <ArticleText>Followed by <strong>African American</strong> students at 6.1 %.</ArticleText>
            <ArticleText>Now looking at a bachelor degree or higher, Asian Americans make up the vast majority at 62.9 %</ArticleText>
            <ArticleText>Asian Americans have the highest rates of higher education in the U.S. and often experience higher income levels and business ownership rates. This might suggest that education is the key to building wealth.

However, when we look at Black Americans with similar education levels, their wealth outcomes are consistently lower. Data from the BWDC shows that in many counties, even with a strong Black college-educated population, homeownership, income, and business ownership rates remain disproportionately low.
            <ArticleText> According to an article by the U.S Congress Joint Economic Committe, In the United States, the typical white family has nearly eight times the wealth of the typical
Black family. Wealth serves as an enabler of opportunity, such that racial disparities in
education, income, housing, retirement and other outcomes can be traced in part to the
persistence of the racial wealth gap.
Education has often been touted as the key to closing the racial wealth gap, but recent analysis
shows that education alone is insufficient. </ArticleText>
This tells us that education matters â€” but it doesn't fully close the racial wealth gap. Structural barriers like discrimination in hiring, wage gaps, access to capital, and historic inequity continue to block wealth-building even for highly educated Black Americans</ArticleText>
